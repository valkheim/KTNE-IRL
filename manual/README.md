# Manual

This is the defusing manual. It provides all necessary informations
(and even more) to defuse the bomb !

## Add a module defusal instructions

When you're implementing a module for the KTNE project,
you should also document it and write defusal informations
about it. The system has been adapted to facilitate the writing process.
All you need to know it that you must write your documentation in a
LaTeX `\subsection{}` in `inc/modules/<module_name>.tex` and run `make` again.

These documents are adapted from [a D&D template](https://github.com/evanbergeron/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template).
