# KTNE-IRL

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, the IRL version.

## Getting Started

This project is about creating a real version of the bomb defusal game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. By getting a copy of the project, you will be provided hardware schematics, software sources, documentation about inner project protocols and deployment informations.

The game is modular. Slaves, organised as modules, treat with a master module accordingly to a specific protocol.

### Prerequisites

We are using Atmega328* micro controllers as you can found on most Arduino boards. You can use their IDE. You will also need the [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire) library.

### Installing

In order to run a minimal setup, you'll need to build and run at least one master module and one slave module.
You will find those two under [examples](examples/).

## Protocol

Master and slaves are communicating using the following protocol which consists of a command type and a value that fit one byte.
Slaves can only respond to the master questions. Thus, a command number refers to a question and an answer.

This table describes the questions asked by the master :

| Command | Parameter    | Meaning              |
| :-----: | :----------: | :------------------: |
| 0       | timeleft (s) | Update timeleft      |
| 1       |              | Defused ?            |
| 2       | level [1;3]  | Update difficulty    |
| 3       |              | User made misktake ? |


This table describes the answers of the slaves :

| Command | Value        | Answer                        |
| :-----: | :----------: | :---------------------------: |
| 0       | 1            | Ok                            |
| 1       | 1            | Yes                           |
| 1       | 0            | No                            |
| 2       | 1            | Ok                            |
| 3       | penality (s) | User potentially made mistake |

## Running the tests

You can debug modules using serial communication.
