# Interface

This arduino interface is written in python. It reads through a port (device name like /dev/ttyUSB0 on linux,
COM3 on windows or whatever serial interface) at a specific baudrate (9600 by default).

It will be useful to integrate computer-controlled scenography (sounds, smoke machines, spotlights, ...)
