# Understanding the examples

As you want to setup the project yourself, you'll better read the following guide. The project consists in one master / n slaves communicating through an I2C bus accordingly to a defined protocol.

## Communication

The communication between the master and the slaves is made by three wires. Two of them are used by the I2C protocol (green and yellow) and the last one (brown) is used by the slaves to notify the master when they need to transmit one or several informations.

All the module have one led green (lit when module is defused) and one led red (when module is not defused).

In the dumb module there is only one button used to defuse the module.

The master has one additional led (yellow) used to notify the user when the bomb has exploded.

## Addressing

Each module needs an address to communicate on the bus. In the master, 4 pins are set to HIGH to provide a way of addressing (see `int as[] = {8, 9, 10, 11};`). The slave can use 0 to 4 pins to binary encode its address (see `getI2CAddr()`)). Let's use a diagram :

```
      +--------------+
      |    MASTER    |
      +--------------+
          |  |  |  |
          |  |  |  |
           \  \  \  \
             \  \  \  \
              |  |  |  |
              |1 |1 |1 |1
         +------------------+
         |      SLAVE       |
         +------------------+
```

Slave address it then 1111(2) or 15(10) or 0x0F(16)

```
      +--------------+
      |    MASTER    |
      +--------------+
          |  |  |  |
          |  |  |  |
           \  \  \  \
             \  \  \  \_____
              |  |  |
              |1 |1 |1 |0
         +------------------+
         |      SLAVE       |
         +------------------+
```

Here, slave address is 1110(2) or 14(10) or 0x0E(16)

## Modules discovery

At serial monitorin start-up, master is scanning (see `scan()`) the 127 I2C available addresses and register them in an `bool addresses[127]` array. So it can ping them later.

## Communication

Protocol consists in questions asked by the master and answers of the slave(s). Each communication contains a command type and a value holding on a single byte.

Master pings every known module using the `void transmit(int addr, byte command, byte value)` function :

```
void pingEveryone()
{
  static byte x = 0;
  for (uint8_t i = 0 ; i < 127 ; ++i)
  {
    if (addresses[i] == true)
    {
      transmit(i,x,x);
      x++;
    }
  }
}

void loop()
{
  pingEveryone();
  delay(500);
}
```

For each transmission, master holds until it receive an answer.
Slave(s) is(are) responding to those transmissions by using `Wire.onRequest(i2c_receive_request);` and `Wire.onReceive(i2c_receive_data);`

The function `i2c_receive_data` is called when the slave receive a transmission from the master. It is used to remember the command type on a global `byte command = 0;` variable. It also retrieves value that may be useful for some commands.

```
void i2c_receive_data(int count)
{
  byte input;
  byte rxCount = 0;

  while (Wire.available() && rxCount < count) {
    input = (byte)Wire.read();
    if (rxCount == 0) {
      command = input;
    }
    else {
      value = input;
    }      
    rxCount++;
  }
}
```

The function `i2c_receive_request` is called when the master needs an answer from its slave (see master's `transmit` function). This handle the slave answer :

```
void i2c_receive_request()
{
  switch(command)
  {
    case 1:
      Wire.write(1);
      break;
    case 2:
      Wire.write(2);
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
}
```

## Wiring

Here is a wiring example :
* Master is an arduino board rev v3 powered via usb cable
* Slave is an arduino board rev v3 powered by master via Vin pin
* Master set up four pins (8, 9, 10, 11) to permit addressing
* Slave use its 4 pins to get an address (an thus gets address 1111(2) or 15(10) or 0x0F(16))
* I2C bus is connected through SDA (Serial Data Line) and SCL (Serial Clock Line) dedicated pins (written A4 and A5 on PCB)
